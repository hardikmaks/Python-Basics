# Set is mutable.
# 'Mutable' means after assigning value to the variable, we can change it as per our need.
# To create list we use ' {} ' - Curly Brackets.

# Notes  :  - Set does'nt support duplicate values.
#           - Set uses concept of hash, so sequence of the output is not fix.
#           - Because sequence is not fix, we can;t use "index number" to fetch value in set.


# Sample Program - 1    :   To create set

s = {4, 3, -31, 59, 8, 45, 14}
print( s )
d = {5, 48, -56, 15, 5, 36}                     # duplicate value will print only 1 time.
print( d )
m = {'maks', 49, -26, 'khsuh'}
print( m )
